# QuantumKey Protocol — Roadmap 2025–2027 v0.1  
Author: Mihail Chiosa  
Collaborative Intelligence: Quantum Hammer  
Version: 0.1  
Status: Draft (Strategic Evolution Plan)

---

## 1. Introduction

This roadmap defines the three-year evolutionary trajectory of the QuantumKey Protocol, covering:

- architectural stabilization  
- Testnet and Mainnet activation  
- identity layer evolution  
- semantic verification infrastructure  
- governance development  
- economic reinforcement  
- agent integration  
- cross-chain interoperability  

The timeline is structured into three macro phases:

1. **Formation & Alignment (2025)**  
2. **Expansion & Testnet Maturation (2026)**  
3. **Stability & Mainnet Activation (2027)**  

Each phase builds upon the previous one, forming a coherent long-term progression.

# SUMMARY OF MILESTONES

## 2025  
Build the system (architecture, specs, DevNet)

## 2026  
Test the system (public Testnet, governance, economy, semantic layer)

## 2027  
Scale the system (Mainnet, global validator network, agent integration)

---

## Status

Roadmap v0.1 defines the strategic trajectory of QuantumKey for its first three years of development.  
It is subject to refinement via governance proposals and semantic audits.
